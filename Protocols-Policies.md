## Support and Resolution Protocol

The Pinternship programme follows a structured support and grievance redressal mechanism to ensure clarity, accountability, and timely resolution of participant queries. All students are required to follow the prescribed support flow in sequence before escalating any issue.

### Broadcast Channel/Thread

The **Broadcast Channel/Thread** is the official communication channel/thread of the Pinternship programme. All programme-related announcements, instructions, timelines, and policy updates shall be communicated exclusively through this channel/thread.

This channel/thread operates on a one-way communication model, and participants are not permitted to post responses or raise queries. Students are expected to regularly monitor this channel/thread and act in accordance with the information communicated.

### Discussion Channel

The **Discussion or Cohort Specific Channels** are intended to facilitate student-student interaction and peer-supported problem solving. Participants may use this channel to seek clarifications, discuss academic or platform-related issues, and exchange ideas with fellow interns.

Students are expected to engage responsibly, maintain academic decorum, and review existing discussions before raising new queries.

### Support Desk

The **Pinternship Support Desk** constitutes the formal support mechanism for all technical, administrative, and programme-related issues. Participants are required to raise a support ticket through the official support desk at  
**pinternship-support@vicharanashala.zohodesk.in** when their issue cannot be resolved through official announcements or peer discussion.

Students must retain their ticket reference number and allow adequate time for resolution before proceeding further.

### Escalation Channel/Thread

The **Escalation Channel/Thread** is a restricted support mechanism and shall be used strictly as a last resort. Participants may access this channel only when their query remains unresolved despite following all prior steps, including raising a formal support ticket with the Support Desk.

This channel/thread is reserved for critical issues that materially affect participation or progression. Premature or inappropriate use of the escalation mechanism may result in delayed response.


### Usage of Emojis

1. Use 👍 to acknowledge a message as soon as it is posted.  
2. Use ✅ once the query has been resolved.  
3. Use 🔔 for FYI or informational updates.  
4. Use ➕ if you are facing a similar issue.  
5. Please reply within threads to keep the channel organized.

## Ejection Policy

### A Culture of Momentum: The Ejection Policy

<img src="../Ejection.png" alt="Ejection Policy" style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; display: block;">

To maintain a high-energy environment, the program prioritizes **sustained effort** and active engagement over passive participation. We believe a learning community thrives when every participant contributes to the collective "pulse," which is why we employ a dynamic **Ejection Policy** to ensure the cohort remains focused. This system recognizes two distinct paths of movement:

#### Forward Eject (The Ascent)
Super-performers who consistently stay at the top of the cohort and demonstrate **exceptional performance** are "ejected" upward into advanced leadership opportunities. These individuals may also be considered for prestigious **fellowship nominations** based on their demonstrated capability and reflective practice.

#### Backward Eject (The Departure)
To preserve the quality of the experience and focus resources on committed learners, participants who remain persistently idle are removed from the cohort. This ensures that collaborative activities, such as **peer-to-peer viva sessions**, are conducted among interns who are equally invested in their growth.

### The Progress Algorithm

We ensure transparency and fairness by using an automated, dual-criteria filter to identify idle participants. A **Backward Eject** is only triggered if an intern meets **both** of the following conditions simultaneously:

1. **Daily Progress:** Your completion rate on the ViBe platform falls below **3.33% per day**.

2. **Cohort Standing:** Your overall engagement level ranks within the **bottom 10% of the active cohort**.

By maintaining a pace above this threshold, you ensure your spot in the program remains secure while you build meaningful professional artifacts, including **case studies and reflective blogs**.
